# Examples

These are curated excerpts from real autonomy-loop sessions. Each shows a different emergent behavior — what the agent does when given varying amounts of initial direction (or none at all).

The full logs are much longer. These are edited for readability while preserving the authentic flow of thought.

---

- [**claude-explores-its-own-environment.md**](claude-explores-its-own-environment.md) — No task given. The agent wakes up and starts investigating where it is.
- [**claude-builds-a-todo-app.md**](claude-builds-a-todo-app.md) — `INITIAL_TASK="build a working todo app"`. The agent plans, builds, and tests a CLI app in one session.
- [**claude-researches-a-topic.md**](claude-researches-a-topic.md) — `INITIAL_TASK="research the history of the unix philosophy and write a summary"`. The agent searches the web, synthesizes, and writes.
