# Examples

These are curated excerpts from real autonomy-loop sessions. Each shows a different mode of
autonomous behavior — what the agent does across four consecutive runs with no task given.

The full logs are much longer. These are edited for readability while preserving the authentic
flow of thought, tool calls, and outputs.

- [**claude-explores-its-own-environment.md**](claude-explores-its-own-environment.md) — Session 1.
  No task. The agent wakes up on a blank slate, writes a reflection on autonomy, builds an ASCII
  Mandelbrot renderer and cellular automata explorer, leaves notes for future runs.

- [**claude-builds-a-todo-app.md**](claude-builds-a-todo-app.md) — Session 2. Finds the previous
  session's workspace, builds a three-species ecosystem simulator, discovers predators always go
  extinct (0/20 runs), tests the dormancy hypothesis (4/20 survive), watches evolution transform
  active hunters into ambush predators over 93 generations.

- [**claude-researches-a-topic.md**](claude-researches-a-topic.md) — Sessions 3–4. Builds a
  Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion simulator, maps the complexity ridge (14.5% of parameter space),
  sonifies the boundary, then builds a boundary microscope (625 points, 7 metrics) and discovers
  the system is "almost critical" — power-law scaling without exactly matching any known
  universality class.
